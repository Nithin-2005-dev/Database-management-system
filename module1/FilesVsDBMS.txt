Why not simply use files?

file system:-
->it is just a system to create files/folders and edit them or delete them

DBMS:-
->it is a software that ends up storing everything in a files.
->it can be used by many people.
e.g:oracle db,MySQL,MS SQL Server,IBM DB2,etc.

1)querying:find all products priced >$100

->data in files just store in csv format so it is difficult to search the data in it.
->the searching can be done with c/c++/JAVA/..
->where as DBMS uses the concept called indexing and the data is stored in files with proper indexing .So,it becomes easier to query the data.

2)Redundancy:Customer table,purchasing table

->DBMS reduces the redundancy i.e repetation of same data.
->it can be done by creating different sets or tables of data with proper id's.

3)Consistency:change the address

->changing something will reflect in every related data in the database.
->where as in files it is difficult to implement this functionality.

4)Data Independence:Hides low levels details from the engineers using the DBMS.

5)secruty & Access control: credit details,personal info.

6)Abstraction & ease of data acess
