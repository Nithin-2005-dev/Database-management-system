->primary key:one of the candidate key that the DB-designer chooses to maintain uniqueness.
It should present in all the records.
there should be atmost one primary key per table.
unique for each row.
...above rules can be combinely called as entity integrity constrains.
**other candidate keys can be NULL.
->Alternative/Secondary keys:-candidate keys that are not primary keys.
->soper key:candidate key Union other attributes
->foregin key:common attribute of two tables and atleast one should be primary key to point the records in other table.It acts as a pointer.
->self referential:having both primary and foregin key in same table.
Relational Schema=table structure + integrity constrains.
