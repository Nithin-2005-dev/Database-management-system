query languages->tools to obtain data from a database->add,modify,delete

there are 3 types of querying languages:
1)relational algebra
2)tuple relational calculus
3)SQL

procedural vs declarative languages:-
1)procedural
->we should give clear instructions on how to generate output for the given output.
2)declarative 
->we just ask what we want and not how to obtain 

Relational algebra:-

basic relational operators:

1)projection(π)
->if a table named "costumer" containing attributes cid,cname,czip
->Πcid,cname(customer)=another table containing only cid and cname as a attributes.
->it takes one relation so it is urinary oparator.
->projection with one attributes having duplicates can't exist.

2)selection(σ)
->σcname=n1(customer)=table containing tuples which are having the cname=n1

3)rename(ρ)
->ρcname|csutname(customer)=it just rename the attribute heading from cname to custname

set oparators:

1)union
->it combines both the relations and writes the common tuples only one time.

2)intersection
->it gives the table containing common tuples

3)difference
->R1-R2=R1-(R1^R2)
->gives the table contating R1 tuples without the tuples which are common in both R1 and R2. 

Compatibility of relations:
R1(c1,c2,c3) , R2(c1,c2) ->not compatiable
R1(c1,c2,c3) , R2(c1,c2,c4) ->not compatiable
