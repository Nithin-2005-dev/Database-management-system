cardinality of relationships:-
one-one
one-many
many-one
many-many

one-one:
if there exists a single relation from both the tables.Then it is called one-one relation
Represented by:
<- ->

one-many:
if there exists a many entities for the sigle entity of other table.Then it is called one-many relation
Represented by:
<- =

one-many:
if there exists a single entity for the many entities of other table.Then it is called one-many relation
Represented by:
= ->

many-many:
if there exists a many entities for the many entities of other table.Then it is called one-many relation
Represented by:
= =


Constructing tables from ER-diagrams:
1)minimize the number of tables
2)every table should have primary key
3)each cell must have only one value
